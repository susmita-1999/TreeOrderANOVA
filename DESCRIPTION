Description: 
    Provides three hypothesis testing procedures for two-way ANOVA 
    under tree-order restrictions: 
    (1) Likelihood Ratio Test (TwoWayTreeLRT), 
    (2) MAX test (TreeMax), and 
    (3) MIN test (TreeMin). 
    All functions use parametric bootstrap to obtain critical values 
    under heteroscedasticity and unequal sample sizes.
